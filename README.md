This is the code repository for [Linux Device Driver Development Cookbook](""), published by Packt.

**Develop custom drivers for your embedded Linux applications**

## What is this book about?
Device drivers play a critical role in how the system performs and ensures that the device works in the intended way.
With a recipe based approach this book gives you practical recipes on character drivers and related kernel internals. It shows you how to start writing Linux device drivers and tools to understand, debug or modify them.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Become familiar with the latest kernel releases (4.19+/5.x) running on the ESPRESSObin devkit, an ARM 64-bit machine
* Download, configure, modify, and build kernel sources
* Add and remove a device driver or a module from the kernel
* Master kernel programming
* Understand how to implement character drivers to manage different kinds of computer peripheral
* Become well versed with kernel helper functions and objects that can be used to build kernel applications
* Acquire a knowledge of in-depth concepts to manage custom hardware with Linux from both the kernel and user space
